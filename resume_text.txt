                                          PROJECTS AT EMERTXE



   Project Number:1
   Title                        Inverted Search
   Project brief                Inverted Search is a C project where I created an inverted index from
                                multiple text files. Each word found in the files is stored in a hash table
                                along with the names of the files where it appears and how many times it
                                occurs. This makes searching for any word across multiple files fast and
                                efficient.


   Technologies used            Advanced C - File Handling, Hash Tables, Linked Lists, and Dynamic
                                Memory, Command line arguments
   Key challenges & Learnings    Learned how to analyze files properly and extract words while handling
                                  case differences and repeated words.
                                 Used hash tables and linked lists to store data efficiently and speed up
                                    search operations.
                                 During Creating the Hash Table same word comes in different files, the
                                  count of the words should be incremented and issue in fetching the
                                  backup data resolved easily by using the file concept and and the
                                  formate specified sscanf.
                                 Faced segmentation faults due to incorrect handling of node
                                  addresses, but fixed them by understanding proper NULL checks and

   Project Number:2
   Title                        Arbitrary Precision Calculator
   Project brief                Arbitrary Precision Calculator is a C based project performing mathematical
                                operations on very large numbers that cannot fit into standard data types
                                like int or long long. To handle such numbers using linked lists, treating
                                each digit as a separate element. Using these structure, the program can
                                accurately perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on
                                numbers of any size without losing precision.


   Technologies used            Advanced C – Pointers, Linked Lists, Structure, Dynamic Memory Allocation,
                                Command line arguments
   Key challenges & Learnings    Implemented custom arithmetic for arbitrarily large numbers without
                                  built-in types.
                                 Faced a struggle in the dividing part where both the subtraction and
                                   addition part both combined to get the solutions.
                                 Identified unused list nodes and memory that was not freed, and
                                  resolved these issues during debugging. Cleared all unused heap
                                  memory by using the Linux tool Valgrind..




   Project Number:3
   Title                        Image Steganography using LSB Encoding and Decoding
   Project brief                The goal was to transfer data or information to the receiver without anyone
                                else being able to read it. I stored the length of the text and then
                                embedded each bit of the message into the least significant bits of the
                                image data. The BMP file was encoded with a magic string to make it easy
                                to identify. During decoding, this magic string helps the receiver confirm
                                that the BMP file contains hidden data. Once verified, the receiver decodes
                                the LSBs one by one and reconstructs the original message.
   Technologies used            Embedded C – File operations, Pointers, Bitwise operations, Functions,
                                Makefiles, Command line arguments
   Key challenges & Learnings    Understanding of pixels and header of image file by doing literature
                                  study
                                 Learned how to hide data in an BMP image with unnoticeable change
                                  in the image
                                 Major challenge is to encoding the files with their extension and the
                                  total size of the file, but solved them with understanding the clear
                                  concept of bitwise and file pointer.

   Title                        Mp3 Tag Reader
   Project brief                MP3 Tag Reader is a C-based project that reads and displays metadata from
                                MP3 audio files. The program extracts information such as the song title,
                                artist name, album, year, genre, and comments from the ID3 tags stored
                                inside the MP3 file. It uses file handling and byte-level parsing to locate the
                                tag header and decode the stored fields, allowing the user to easily view
                                the details of any MP3 file.
   Technologies used            Advanced C – File Pointers,Structure.
   Key challenges & Learnings    Faced a challenge while reading the tag size because the integer values
                                  were stored in big-endian format , resolved the issue by converting
                                  them to little-endian before processing.
                                 Improved knowledge of string handling, pointer usage, and modular
                                  programming while parsing different metadata fields.
                                 Editing a tag was done by updating the tag fields inside the structure
                                  and then overwriting the MP3 file with the new user-provided data.



   Project number:5
   Title                        Address Book
   Project brief                The Address Book is a C application that built to store and manage contact
                                details like name, phone number, and email. It lets the user add new
                                contacts, search for existing ones, update details, delete entries, and view
                                the full list. Used proper input checks and a modular design to keep the
                                data handling clean and efficient.
   Technologies used            Advanced C – Pointers, Structures, File Handling, Command line arguments
   Key challenges & Learnings    Faced difficulties while adding proper input validation for names,
                                  phone numbers, and emails, which helped me understand error
                                  handling better.
                                 Had challenges managing file operations and making sure data was
                                  stored and retrieved correctly, which improved my skills in data
                                  persistence.
                                 Learned more about the structure and the file pointers to store and
                                  initialize the stored content back to the sturucture.
                                 Added an extra feature to manage separate categories like family,
                                  friends, and colleagues, which required careful planning of data
                                  structure and menu flow.

   Title                        Automation in Vacuum Ironing Table
   Project brief                The project focuses on automating a vacuum ironing table so that it turns
                                ON only when a person is nearby and turns OFF automatically when not in
                                use. A PIR sensor is used to detect human presence, and based on the
                                sensor output, the ESP32 controls a relay circuit that powers the ironing
                                table. This helps save electricity and prevents overheating or accidents.
   Technologies used            Arduino IDE, ESP-32, PIR sensor, Relay
   Key challenges & Learnings    Faced challenges in calibrating the PIR sensor to correctly detect
                                   human presence and avoid false triggers.
                                 Learned to interface ESP32 with relay and transistor driver circuits to
                                   safely switch AC loads.
                                 Improved understanding of automation, safety control, and sensor-
                                   based switching for real-time applications.
